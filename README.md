# homework2-portfolio

## Portfolio of my work.

- My motivation for this project was to showcase my work for potential future employers.
- I built this project so that my work could be seen in one central location.
- I only need one link for potential employers to navigate to to see my work.
- I learned many HTML and CSS tricks and tools to create this page.

## Acceptance Criteria

    GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
    WHEN I load their portfolio
    THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
    WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
    THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
    WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
    THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
    WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
    THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
    WHEN I click on the images of the applications
    THEN I am taken to that deployed application
    WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
    THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## Usage

Users are able to click on the photos which will take them to linked pages with my current work.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![screenshot](./assets/css/images/ScreenShot)
